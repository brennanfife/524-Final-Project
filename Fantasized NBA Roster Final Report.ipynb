    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This report seeks to design optimization models around selecting NBA players for an NBA team. Since the 1940s, NBA teams have utilized specialized tools, statistics, and models to assist them in constructing optimal lineups. As listed by [nbastuffer.com](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/nba-teams-that-have-analytics-department/), every NBA team currently has an analytics department, supplying their organizations with knowledge of how to best match current rosters with offseason transactions. Even popular games such as the NBA 2K series to ESPN's Fantasy Basketball League, have given hardcore fans the chance to craft a fantasized lineup for their favorite clubs. With such demand, we will examine two models one can take to assist them in selecting for an optimal, fantasized NBA lineup. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In our first model**, we look to maximize a team's winning percentage by selecting players around their offensive (higher = better) and defensive (lower = better) efficiency rating from the 2018-2019 NBA season (provided by [NBAstatstuffer.com]((https://www.nbastuffer.com/2018-2019-nba-player-stats/))). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, using these two parameters, by using player's salaries (provided by [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html)), we can offer various lineups for teams. This model takes advantage of integer linear programming with binary variables. Whereas linear programming maximizes (or minimizes) a linear objective function (subject to one or more constraints), integer linear programming adds the additional condition that players' selection can only either zero (don't choose this player), or one, (choose this player). Thus, we get a decisive decision on who to select and who not to select.\n",
    "To simplify problem, assumptions that we made include:\n",
    "1. Each team consists of five starters and five benchers.\n",
    "2. Due to the limitation of dataset, each team has two centers (one for starter and one for bencher), 4 forwards (two for starter, two for bencher), and four guards(two for starter, two for bencher).\n",
    "3. The contribution of starters and benchers to a whole team is weighted.\n",
    "4. All the data (salary of each player, salary cap of each team, offensive and deffensive rating, PERs, positions, ...) are from 2018-2019 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the second model**, rather than using efficiency ratings, we apply a player's shooting 'sweet spot', which is player's best shooting spots, to optimize the lineup. By considering both the number of 'sweet spots' of the whole team and its distribution on the half court, we can calculate the optimal lineup a team can have on the court. In this model, we synthetically generated x, y coordinates(based on the basketball image attached below, the range for x coordinate of 'sweet spot' is from 0 to 24 ft and for y coordinate of 'sweet spot' is from 0 to 48), corresponding to halfcourt (only focus the shooting area), and accounted for a player's positions (e.g., centers shoot near the rim, whereas guards shoot three-pointers). From thirty players, we pick a lineup of five (two guards, two forwards, and a center). To simplify problem, assumptions that we made include:\n",
    "1. Each team only has five players.\n",
    "2. There are two guards, two forwards, and one center in each team.\n",
    "3. The offensive area is 24 by 48 (ft), since we only focus on the normal shooting area.\n",
    "4. Dataset ((x, y) coordinates of sweet spots a player has) are generated based on their position.\n",
    "5. In total, we use thirty players and generate the combinations of five players that have a center, two forwards, and two guards.\n",
    "6. Assumes that an optimal team consists of a team with equal opportunity to score in all areas of our 24x48 ft space\n",
    "7. Does not account for a team's defensive capacity, it simply holds preference for offensive balance\n",
    "8. The importance is on the zones, not the position of the points within the zones, though generally, that information could be found prevalent in an efficiency analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "![fixit flowchart][flow]\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of these models, we first provide the mathematical model and the corresponding code, we examine results, offer our interpretations of the data, any limitations we experienced, and possible improvements that could be made.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2A. Winning Percentage Model\n",
    "In this model, we are using real dataset to find the fantasy NBA roster based on optimizing the winning percentage of a team. We use all the players offensive rating(# of points that player can get, higher better), and defensive rating(# of points that player can lose, lower better) to measure the team's winning percentage.\n",
    "#### Type of the model: Linear program with binary variable\n",
    "The winning percentage model is a linear program with binary variable. A 0-1 binary variable is used to pick players.\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "Below is the table that contains all the variables used in this math model.\n",

    "**Note**: Variable $p_i$ is a 0-1 binary variable, where 0 means do not choose this player and 1 means choose this player.\n",
    "#### Objective function\n",
    "The objective function indicates the relationship between winning percentage and starters and benchers' defensive rating and offensive rating. In the equation, $w_i$ is weights of each term. It is trained by minimizing least square error in the real dataset that contains 30 real NBA team's winning percentage and corresponding players defense and offense rating. In the data that will introduce in the solution section(3A. [Winning Percentage Model](#3A.-Winning-Percentage-Model)), from index $i = 1$ to $i =5n$ are starter players, and from index $i = 5n + 1$ to $i =10n$ are bencher players. Since there are 30 teams in the leagure, we set n = 30 in our solution section. The equation is given below: <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "The second type of constraint is to restrict the amount of player in each position. In the dataset, index $i=1$ to $i=n$ is starter center, index $i=n+1$ to $i=3n$ is starter forward, index $i=3n+1$ to $i=5n$ is starter guard, and from $i=5n+1$ to $i=10n$ is the bencher in same sequence as starters.\n",

    "The objective function is trying to balence the total amount of team's sweet spots and the distribution of these sweet spots. The first term before minus sign in the objective function below is the total amount of team's sweet spots, the second term represents the function to evaluate the distrbution because a team that has all the sweet spots in a small region is definitely not a good team even though the total number of sweet spots is huge. So in our math model, we divide the court in to n parts (specificlly, here in solution section, we set n equals 9) and assign each player's collection of sweet spots to each of this n parts of the court. Since the best distribution is when the team's sweet spots are evenly distributed, that is each partition has the same amount of sweet spots(total divided by n), we then use the the second term to measure the difference between real distribution and optimal distribution and try to minize it so there is a minus sign before it.<br>\n",

The data structure we used was a dictionary, containing an array of arrays of tuples, specifically, 1 array per player name that holds 9 arrays (corresponding to the 9 zones on the court) with each of these arrays containing a random number of x, y coordinates corresponding to a player's \"sweet spots\". Based on a player's primary position, a random number of sweet spots were generated within specific zones (*centers:* **zones 1, 4, and 7**; *forwards:* **zones 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8**; and *guards:* **zones 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9**) and then a random amount from 2 to 6 were assigned across **all zones** for each player. The majority of the areas were players can score were assumed based on their position, and doing so places added importance on teams with balanced lineups (standard being 1 center, 2 forwards, and 2 guards)."

    "Given the 300 possible players, going by raw efficiency ratings, these five starters and five bench players are who a managing group should target in building their team. This win percentage (99.9%) depends on the team performing as expected by their raw statistical data (bench and starters), in other words, optimally, this team will not lose. One may notice the bench has abnormally high offensive ratings and low defensive ratings. This happens because of the small sample size for these inexperienced players. And, considering the inexperienced bench players would have a lower salary than the more experienced starters, they are able to bypass our budget constraint while still delivering unreasonably high values. This is a limitation of our data set. A more reasonable resulting win percentage is found in our calculation of just the five starters, which was 70.8% when optimal. "

    "The sweet spot model takes advantage of a 24 by 48 court (the entire width and up to the three point line in length). In this model, we had randomly generated data based on a players positions (centers closer to the rim, forwards further from the rim and at the rim, and guards closer to the three point line). The majority of their points are constrained to these positions, but they may possess sweet spots outside these positions. The results shown above reflect the team that functions most proficiently at all dimensions of the court we have specified. The idea is that this model will hold even if we were to add more than the nine zones. In fact, by adding more zones, we prioritize a team that can perform effectively within a designated shooting area. This should create an emphasis on a sweet spot's position on the court, rather than purely on the zone in which it lies.<br> The approach we decided to take is sufficient for an offensive overview but lacks consideration for a team with explicit defensive prowess."

    "This report offers two separate models one could take to optimize an NBA basketball roster. In the first model, through Linear Programming with binary variable for choosing players, and using a player's efficiency ratings, salary, and salary caps, we looked at how one could maximize a team's winning percentage. In the second model, we found how one could maximize a lineup sweet spot by using tradeoffs between the sweet spot distribution and the total sweet lineup. However, we could always improve our results, whether by using real data (for x, y coordinates) or including other constraints, such as injuries or existing team chemistry."
