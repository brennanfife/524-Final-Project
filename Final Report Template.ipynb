You should address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated?) Also give an outline of the rest of the report.\n",

You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **I will be running your code**. I suggest having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution. You may also solve several versions of your problem with different models/assumptions.\n",
