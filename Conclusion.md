# Conclusion
This report offers two separate models one could use to optimize a roster for an NBA basketball team. In the first model, by utilizing Mixed Integer Linear Programming, we looked at how one could maximize the team's winning percentage. This was based around the offensive efficiency rating, defensive efficiency rating, and budget of the 2018-2019 season. In the second model, we found how one could maximizing the sweet spot of each team using tradeoff between the sweet spot distribution and the total amount of sweet of a lineup. However, we could always improve our results, whether it be by using real (for x,y data) data or including other constraints such as injuries and existing team chemistry.
