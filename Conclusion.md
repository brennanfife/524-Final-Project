# Conclusion
Our report provides two different models one could use to optimize an NBA basketball team. The first one is based on maximizing the winning percentage of a team, utilizing Mixed Integer Linear Programming. Here, we assumed each team consisted of 5 starters and 5 bench players, assigning two of them to each position. We then place our variables in the given objective function, which all data was taken from the 2018-2019 season.
The second one is based on maximizing the sweet spot of each team.

What we can do better in the future...
- Getting real data with the x,y coordinates to match real world results.
