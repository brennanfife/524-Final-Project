    "### 2A. Winning Percentage Model\n",
    "In this model, we are using real dataset to find the fantasy NBA roster based on optimizing the winning percentage.\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "1. Each team consists of 5 starters and 5 benchers.\n",
    "2. Each position (SG, PG, SF, PF, C) has two players, one for starter, and one for player.\n",
    "3. The contribution of starters and benchers to a whole team is weighted.\n",
    "4. All the data (salary of each player, salary cap of each team, offensive and deffensive rating, PERs, positions, ...) are from 2018-2019 season.\n",
