# Introduction
Since the 1940s, NBA teams have utilized specialized tools, statistics, and models to assist them in constructing optimal lineups. As listed byÂ [nbastuffer.com](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/nba-teams-that-have-analytics-department/), every NBA team currently has an analytics department, supplying their organizations with knowledge of how to best match current rosters with offseason transactions. Even popular games such as the NBA 2K series to ESPN's Fantasy Basketball League, have given hardcore fans the chance to craft a fantasized lineup for their favorite clubs. With such demand, we will examine two models one can take to assist them in selecting for an optimal, fantasized NBA lineup. 

**In our first model**, we look to maximize a team's winning percentage by selecting players around their offensive and defensive efficiency rating from the 2018-2019 NBA season (provided by [NBAstatstuffer.com]((https://www.nbastuffer.com/2018-2019-nba-player-stats/))), salaries (provided by [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html)) salary caps, and weighted experience. This model takes advantage of Mixed Integer Linear Programming. Whereas linear programming maximizes (or minimizes) a linear objective function (subject to one or more constraints), mixed integer programming adds one additional condition that at least one of the variables can only take on integer values. Thus, we get a decisive decision on who to select and not to select. An example would appear as such...

| Player                | Position | Off % | Def % |
|-----------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Rudy Gobert           | C        | 133.8 | 96.7  |
| Giannis Antetokounmpo | F        | 121.6 | 93.9  |
| Derrick Favors        | F        | 124.5 | 98.1  |
| James Harden          | G        | 118.6 | 103.5 |
| Eric Bledsoe          | G        | 115.8 | 101.0 |

**Win Percentage: 69.4%**

**In the second model**, we seek to maximize the sweet spot of each team by using tradeoff to select players based on the sweet spot distribution and the total amount of sweet of a lineup. Here, the data was synthetically generated with x, y coordinate depending on the player's position (e.g. center shooting near the rim while guards shoot 3-pointers). We have thirty players and pick up 5, with each lineup consisting of two guards, two forwards, and one center. The offensive area is only focused on halfcourt (the shooting area).

In both of these sets, we first provide the mathematical model and the corresponding code, we examine results, offer our interpretations of the data, any limitations we experienced, and possible improvements that could be made for future use.
